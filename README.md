# Online-Retailer-Business---Toylica-Case-Study (using SQL)
The online retailing business has surged in popularity, offering a convenient way for companies to sell products through their websites. Toylica, a company specializing in manufacturing toy replicas, has successfully captured a global market, supplying products to nearly every country. Wholesale buyers place orders in required quantities directly from Toylica’s website. With an expanding customer base and workforce, it is essential for Toylica to maintain a robust database to manage and store information related to employees, customers, and products.

Toylica has a dedicated department for analyzing sales data and building machine learning models to predict future sales trends. Customer orders are stored in the database through an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) system. Data analysts and machine learning engineers use Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) tasks on historical data to develop effective marketing strategies and enhance business operations.

As a data analyst at Toylica, your primary responsibility is to create SQL queries to gain insights into the company’s sales. Understanding the structure and process of Toylica's database is crucial. The database is divided into three main sections:

Employee Section: Includes tables for employees (identified by employeeNumber) and offices (identified by officeCode), where each employee is assigned to a specific office.

Customer Section: Includes tables for customers (identified by customerNumber), orders (identified by orderNumber), order details (with composite primary key orderNumber and productCode), and payments (identified by checkNumber).

Product Section: Includes tables for products (identified by productCode) and product lines, which categorize toy models (e.g., vintage cars, motorcycles).

Toylica's database, comprising eight tables, provides a comprehensive framework for storing and analyzing data. Your task is to leverage SQL queries to extract meaningful insights, thereby aiding in strategic decision-making to drive Toylica's business forward.
